        <p>Content creation bottlenecks swell up when a marketing team relies too much on a small group of specialized pros to produce a large volume of video content.

Lumen5 makes it easy to repurpose all of your existing marketing assets and messaging into captivating bite-sized videos optimized for online distribution. Multiply the content you already have and work smarter, not harder.t
